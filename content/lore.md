Though the connection between Fae and many worlds waxes and wanes, in Avalon it is always strong.
Avalon is a land between; between Fae and the realms of men; between the magical and the mundane.
Its inhabitants are a jumble of bloodlines as difficult to pin down as the endlessly shifting mists.


## Bloodlines ##

Those that survive and rule in Avalon are most often descendents of ancient priests who crossed over from the mortal world.
But in order to thrive, their ancestors made pacts and marriages with the powerful native beings and other travellers in Fae.

* Faerie (Sun,Nature) - the namesakes of Fae, Faeries express the creative and orderly aspects of Nature
* Vampiric (Moon,Morality) - best known for consuming blood, Vampiric beings of all types are moon-creatures like the Were,
	but associate with the energy of the new moon, rather than the full moon
* Were (Nature,Moon) - although frowned upon by mortals, were-beings are simply an expression of wild and simple Nature
* Aethaeric (Morality,Myst) - often called angels and demons, Aethaeric beings are in tune with the primal forces of good and evil
* Doppleganger (Myst,Sun) - their true nature is hard to pin down, as they easily shift and adopt the forms of others
	Among scholars it is generally speculated that they represent the fused energies of Myst and Sun, as this would complete the great energy wheel.


## Priestly Cults ##

Each major group of deities has distinct priesthood traditions.
The adepts of these cults tend to congregate in their patrons' courts in the high or low realms.
